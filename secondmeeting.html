		<p>You meet with your mentor at Hauptbahnhof and head off to the platform. She's always on the go, she has to be, otherwise things won't get done. The train station was the best meeting spot for her. 
		</p> 
		<p>Once on board the train you start discussing the purpose of the internship. She wants to make sure you get a worthwhile experience and don't waste your time. She asks, "What are your goals?"</p>
